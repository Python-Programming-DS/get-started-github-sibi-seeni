**About Me** 👋

I’m a graduate student in Applied Data Science at University of Florida (UF '27), with a strong foundation in Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Data Engineering. My journey spans across industry, research, and leadership roles, where I’ve built scalable AI systems, optimized data pipelines, and led cross-functional projects.

**My Technical Toolkit** 🛠️

Languages: Python, SQL
Libraries/Frameworks: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Spark, Flask
Cloud Platforms: AWS
Tools: Databricks, Jupyter Notebooks, Git, Docker

**What I’m Interested In** 🌱

I’m passionate about the intersection of machine learning research and engineering. I enjoy working on scalable model deployment, AI prototyping, and data-driven decision-making.

**Mentorship & Leadership** 🤝

I mentor peers through GatorAI at UF and have previously led SIGMA, the Data Analytics Club at NIT Trichy, where we collaborated on innovative data-driven solutions and won hackathons.

**Outside of Work** 🌍

When I’m not working on data, you can find me exploring new AI technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or engaging in activities like sports, reading, and traveling.
